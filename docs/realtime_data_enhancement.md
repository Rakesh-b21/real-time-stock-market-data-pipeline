# Real-Time Data Storage Enhancement

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive changes made to enhance the real-time stock data storage functionality, implementing insert-only data storage, batch ARIMA model training, and simplified historical data management.

## 🔄 **Key Changes Made**

### 1. **Database Schema Changes**
- **Removed Primary Key Constraint**: The `company_id` primary key constraint on `stock_prices_realtime` has been removed
- **Added Surrogate Primary Key**: New `realtime_id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY` column for unique record identification
- **Multiple Records Support**: Now allows multiple records per `(company_id, trade_datetime)` combination
- **Enhanced Indexing**: Added performance indexes for efficient querying by company and datetime
- **Automated Triggers**: Added timestamp update triggers for data integrity

### 2. **Producer Changes (`producer/producer.py`)**

#### **Real-Time Data Storage**
- **Always Insert**: Changed from upsert to insert-only operation
- **No Conflicts**: Removed `ON CONFLICT` clause to allow multiple records
- **Enhanced Logging**: Added debug logging for data insertion tracking

#### **Historical Data Management**
- **Batch Migration**: Replaced individual historical inserts with batch migration
- **Latest Records**: Uses database function to get latest records per date from real-time table
- **Simplified Logic**: Removed complex SCD Type 2 logic in favor of simpler end-date approach

#### **ARIMA Integration**
- **Batch Training**: Added batch ARIMA model training at end of all cycles
- **Data Feeding**: Automatically feeds accumulated real-time data to ARIMA models
- **Performance Optimized**: Training occurs after data collection, not during real-time processing

### 3. **Database Functions**

#### **`get_latest_realtime_per_date()`**
```sql
-- Returns latest record per company per date from real-time table
-- Uses DISTINCT ON for efficient latest record selection
-- Includes all necessary price and volume data
```

#### **`migrate_realtime_to_historical()`**
```sql
-- Migrates latest real-time records to historical table
-- Uses trade_date as both start_date and end_date for simplicity
-- Handles conflicts with upsert logic
-- Returns count of migrated records
```

## 🚀 **Benefits of Changes**

### **Data Integrity**
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Every price change is now recorded
- **No Data Loss**: Insert-only approach prevents accidental overwrites
- **Temporal Accuracy**: Multiple records per timestamp capture all market movements

### **Performance Improvements**
- **Reduced Lock Contention**: No more upsert conflicts during high-frequency updates
- **Batch Processing**: ARIMA training moved to end of cycles for better resource utilization
- **Optimized Queries**: New indexes improve query performance for analytics

### **Analytics Enhancement**
- **Better ARIMA Training**: Models trained on complete dataset after all cycles
- **Historical Consistency**: Historical data derived from real-time ensures consistency
- **Simplified Date Handling**: End-date approach removes complexity of start/end date management

## 📋 **Migration Steps**

### **1. Apply Database Schema Changes**
```bash
# Run the migration script
psql -h localhost -U your_username -d your_database -f db/migration_realtime_changes.sql
```

### **2. Verify Schema Changes**
```sql
-- Check new table structure
\d stock_prices_realtime

-- Verify new functions exist
\df get_latest_realtime_per_date
\df migrate_realtime_to_historical

-- Test migration function
SELECT migrate_realtime_to_historical();
```

### **3. Update Application Configuration**
- Ensure all environment variables are properly set
- Verify ARIMA configuration in `.env` file
- Check database connection settings

### **4. Test the Enhanced System**
```bash
# Start the enhanced producer
python producer/producer.py

# Monitor logs for:
# - Real-time data insertion (no conflicts)
# - Historical data migration counts
# - ARIMA batch training results
```

## 🔧 **Configuration Options**

### **Environment Variables**
```bash
# Producer Configuration
MAX_CYCLES=100              # Number of data collection cycles
POLL_INTERVAL=10            # Seconds between cycles
TICKERS=AAPL,MSFT,GOOGL    # Comma-separated ticker symbols

# ARIMA Configuration
ARIMA_MIN_DATA_POINTS=50    # Minimum data points for training
ARIMA_UPDATE_FREQUENCY=24   # Hours between model updates

# Database Configuration
POSTGRES_DSN=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db  # Optional DSN override
```

### **Batch Training Parameters**
- **Minimum Data Points**: 50 records required for ARIMA training
- **Data Window**: Uses last 200 records for training efficiency
- **Training Trigger**: Occurs at end of all data cycles
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure handling per ticker

## 📊 **Monitoring and Validation**

### **Real-Time Data Validation**
```sql
-- Check for multiple records per company/datetime
SELECT company_id, trade_datetime, COUNT(*) as record_count
FROM stock_prices_realtime 
GROUP BY company_id, trade_datetime 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY record_count DESC;
```

### **Historical Data Validation**
```sql
-- Verify historical data migration
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_historical_records
FROM stock_prices_historical;

-- Check latest records per company
SELECT c.ticker_symbol, h.trade_date, h.close_price
FROM stock_prices_historical h
JOIN companies c ON h.company_id = c.company_id
WHERE h.is_current = TRUE
ORDER BY c.ticker_symbol, h.trade_date DESC;
```

### **ARIMA Model Status**
```bash
# Use the status checker script
python check_arima_status.py
```

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

#### **Migration Errors**
- **Constraint Conflicts**: Ensure old constraints are properly dropped
- **Data Type Issues**: Verify timestamp formats are consistent
- **Permission Errors**: Check database user permissions for DDL operations

#### **ARIMA Training Issues**
- **Insufficient Data**: Ensure at least 50 data points per ticker
- **Memory Issues**: Reduce data window size if memory constraints exist
- **Model Convergence**: Check logs for convergence warnings

#### **Performance Issues**
- **Index Usage**: Verify new indexes are being used in query plans
- **Batch Size**: Adjust batch processing parameters if needed
- **Connection Pooling**: Consider connection pooling for high-frequency operations

### **Validation Queries**
```sql
-- Check real-time data insertion rate
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('hour', trade_datetime) as hour, COUNT(*) as records
FROM stock_prices_realtime 
WHERE trade_datetime > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY hour;

-- Verify historical migration success
SELECT migrate_realtime_to_historical() as migrated_count;

-- Check ARIMA data availability
SELECT c.ticker_symbol, COUNT(*) as data_points
FROM stock_prices_realtime rt
JOIN companies c ON rt.company_id = c.company_id
GROUP BY c.ticker_symbol
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 50
ORDER BY data_points DESC;
```
